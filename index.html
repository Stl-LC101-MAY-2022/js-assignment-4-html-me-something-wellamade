               Growing up I was surrounded by both love and loss. My single mother showered me in affection, gifts, and confidence since day one. It was just the two of us for the most part but one day a neighborhood Mama cat gave birth to her kittens in our backyard. Mama Cat and her kittens were brought inside, we sold off the kittens when they were ready but we kept Mama Cat and her orange kitten. I named him Johnny after Jony Bravo. Evently we had another cat join our home, Cleo, he took to Johnny very quickly, they were inseperable.
               <br>
               <br>
               Eventually the cats were rehomed as my mother's new partner was allergic. Not long after their wed I met the first dog love of my life. This little puppy with the biggest belly was named Zoë.

               Zoë had the personality of a grumpy old lady forced into the body of a creature in desperate need to run and catch balls. 
               
               When she was just a wee puppy she had a brush with death, consuming a hot dog that was the length of her body. Puppys, am I right? After successfully surviving she lived her life fully and in favor of me. We slept together every night, playing catch me if you can around the house, going turbo often.

               Her cranky attitude paired perfectly with my teenage moodiness. She didn't trust men and a couple of "friends" who ended up being fiends. She was my little cow, she passed this last year, 2021. I was grateful she got to live such a full life with so much love.

               Po came into my life from a friend who didn't have the space for her anymore. Coincidentaly I was going throuhg the most difficult semester of college. The demands for snuggles and companion ship during all nighters were deeply appreciated. Po loved playing with light beams, feather wands, and my fingers. After college I was moving across the country so I handed her off to good friend she is still with to this day.

               In the year of 2019 I decided it was time I took on the responsibility of tending to my own cat of my choosing. I came across a video from a foster of a pregnant cat eating her wet food making a sound like "yummy, yummy, yummy". I was immediately in love, she was so sassy like my gal's Po and Zoë. I got to watch her give birth on a live stream and met her two kittens. After she was fixed and the babies were old enough I picked up my girl on June 8th.

               At that time I was living with two roomates and their two cats. They were given plenty of time to smell each other and switch places without being seen, before introducing them to each other. To make a long story short, they tolerated each other at best, Bean waas territorial of our bedroom but if the other cats snuck in she'd allow it. However, my lap, was her's without question. 
               <br>
               <br>
               When we moved to another apartments Bean was terrified. The reason she was in the foster's home was because she was found after her first owner abandoned her for 3 months, which is how she got pregnant. She was so anxious I was goign to leave her too. When we got to the new place and she realized I was keeping her, she cried on my chest. It was so sweet and endearing! She was still her grouchy self but she had an exceptionally large soft spot for me.

            <p>
               Just one year after that move we were on the move again but this time across the country, she was as anxious as any cat would be with moving but not as much as the first time. the 36hr drive was a lot but she was a trooper. She loves our new home without having to share space with any other cats or any other humans. She gets excited to have guests over and makes sure I know when she needs pets. Bean is a very vocal kitty, really knows how to communicate. At some point we will using those training buttons, she already knows how to do cool tricks like high five, kisses, and speak.
