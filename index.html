<!-- Write your HTML in this file!
      Tell a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or neither. 
      You can do whatever you like, but it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections. 
      Here are some other ideas:
        a. Create a résumé page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.
        b. Describe a trip you took.
        c. Talk about one of your hobbies or passions.

      Does each of the following:
        a. Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: <p>, <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>. 
           If you need to review any of these tags, check out the HTML tag reference at w3schools.
        b. Uses at least one <img> tag (hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them 
            in a new subfolder called images within your html-me-something directory.
        c. Uses at least one HTML entity. Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will 
            afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.
        d. Demonstrates creativity. Don’t stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, 
           and make it great. And dig into the w3schools HTML reference to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!

               Growing up I was surrounded by both love and loss. My single mother showered me in affection, gifts, and confidence since day one. It was just the two of us for the most part but one day a neighborhood Mama cat gave birth to her kittens in our backyard. Mama Cat and her kittens were brought inside, we sold off the kittens when they were ready but we kept Mama Cat and her orange kitten. I named him Johnny after Jony Bravo. Evently we had another cat join our home, Cleo, he took to Johnny very quickly, they were inseperable.
               <br>
               <br>
               Eventually the cats were rehomed as my mother's new partner was allergic. Not long after their wed I met the first dog love of my life. This little puppy with the biggest belly was named Zoë.

               Zoë had the personality of a grumpy old lady forced into the body of a creature in desperate need to run and catch balls. 
               
               When she was just a wee puppy she had a brush with death, consuming a hot dog that was the length of her body. Puppys, am I right? After successfully surviving she lived her life fully and in favor of me. We slept together every night, playing catch me if you can around the house, going turbo often.

               Her cranky attitude paired perfectly with my teenage moodiness. She didn't trust men and a couple of "friends" who ended up being fiends. She was my little cow, she passed this last year, 2021. I was grateful she got to live such a full life with so much love.
